<p>I am nonbinary and aroace. I support <b>disability pride</b> and <b>all of them</b>. </p>
<p>communicate with me if you feel any kind of issue with me! I don't usually encounter this or it's very rare</p>
<p>I do not engage in lack of real-world, or with people who always water down terms (ask me what I truly mean by this!)</p>
<p>If something about me is private, I want to keep it that way.</p>
